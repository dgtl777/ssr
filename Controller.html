    Most PC gamers swear by using a keyboard and mouse, but if you prefer to play with a controller, you can use Microsoft’s Xbox Core Controller instead.
The controller has a standard layout with two analog sticks, four face buttons, four triggers, and a directional pad. This setup allows the Core Controller to be used with just about any game. We love the overall performance of Microsoft’s controller, but the directional pad is a little less responsive than we’d like.
You can pair this controller to your computer wirelessly using Bluetooth, which means you won’t have to worry about losing a USB dongle. It can last up to 30 hours per charge on a pair of rechargeable AAs or a rechargeable battery (sold separately). There are many great Bluetooth gaming controllers out there, but Xbox’s Core Controller offers the best performance and most comfort.
