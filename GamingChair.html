    Long gaming sessions lead to serious back pain if you don’t have the right chair.
Andaseat’s Jungle has ergonomic features like a high-back design to cradle your entire body, height-adjustable arm rests, a headset pillow, and a lumbar pillow. We’ve gotten a chance to try the chair out for ourselves, and it’s a definite improvement over using an office chair. The ability to move the lumbar pillow up or down to accommodate the length of your back.
The chair can be tilted back from 90 to 160 degrees, so you can stretch out, or find a comfortable position. Its roller wheels also allow you to easily adjust your positioning with your desk to find the sweet spot. The wheels roll smoothly, but they’re not too sensitive; you won’t accidentally roll yourself around if you stretch.
Hunching over for hours each day can lead to serious back problems over time, so upgrading your seat can help improve your game and your health.
