    One of the dangers of playing games for multiple hours a day is overexposure to blue light, which some scientific reports say can screw up your sleep schedule by tricking your brain into thinking it’s daytime.
    The best way to reduce your exposure to blue light (besides limiting your screen time) is using a pair of specially designed glasses. This unisex pair from Aomaste features UV protection, and can filter out 90% of blue light before it reaches your eyes by using lenses with a slightly amber tint.  Aomaste says the glasses have strong hinges, comfortable nose pads, and a curved temple to ensure they’re comfortable to wear for hours at a time. These materials are non-toxic, too.
    Having tried blue light reduction glasses for ourselves, we highly recommend them to anyone who spends most of their day looking at a screen. We’ve definitely noticed a reduction in eye strain at the end of the day whether we were playing games or not.
