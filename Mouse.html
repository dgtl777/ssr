    Logitech’s G502 is a high performance gaming mouse that perfectly complements an RBG keyboard.
The wired mouse uses a 25,600DPI (dots per inch) optical sensor to track your movements with pinpoint precision, and uses spring loaded mechanical switches to ensure each click you make is instantly recognized by the game. The G502 has 11 programmable buttons, and allows you to set five different “profiles” or button configurations, so you can switch between different setups for your most-played games.
Fast paced games require precise mouse movements, which is why Logitech includes five 3.6 gram weights that you can insert into a slot at the bottom of the G502. You can literally change the weight of the mouse to help improve your accuracy. The G502 has a few LEDs on the top and sides, which can be programmed to one of 16.8 million colors, so you’ll be able to match the look of your RGB keyboard.
Logitech even took great care in designing the outer shell of the G502, which has a thumb rest on the side, so you can hold the mouse more comfortably while reducing resistance. The textured rubber grips on both sides will prevent your hands from slipping.
