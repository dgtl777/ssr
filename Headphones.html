<b>HyperX's Cloud Revolver: A gaming Headset</b>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    HyperX’s Cloud Revolver is an over-ear headset with ultra plus earcups for comfort and a steel band for durability. It supports true stereo sound or simulated 7.1 surround sound, which can help you hear enemies coming from all directions, and its detachable microphone allows you to communicate with your teammates clearly in real time.
    The Cloud Revolver is a wired headset, which means you must keep it connected to your computer using a cable. This may seem limiting, but it ensures you’ll have zero latency (lag) when speaking to allies or listening for enemies. You can also plug the headset into a PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, mobile devices, or a VR headset.
