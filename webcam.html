    Your best option right now is AUKEY’s Full HD webcam, which allows you to stream 1080P video with ease. We recommend using a USB microphone for the best sound, but this webcam’s stereo mics will work in a pinch, too.
    This webcam is designed to sit on top of your monitor or laptop lid, and can be tilted up or down, so you can get the right angle. The webcam is compatible with both PCs and Macs, and can be used with any major streaming app. While we’re recommending Aukey’s webcam as a gaming accessory, it can also be used for videoconferencing during remote learning or work.
