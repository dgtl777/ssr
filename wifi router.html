    Playing PC games online requires a really strong internet connection. Even a momentary drop in speed can give your competition the advantage.
Ideally you’d have your computer directly connected to your WiFi router via Ethernet, but that might not be possible depending on your living situation, and where wires were placed in your house.
If you need to rely on WiFi, I recommend getting a set of three eero mesh WiFi routers. One of them has to be connected to your cable modem, but the other two can be placed anywhere in your house.
The three routers will connect to one another, and create a strong, consistent connection throughout your entire place. This set of eero routers is designed for homes up to 5,000 square feet, but you can add additional routers, or jump up to eero’s Pro line, if you live in a bigger place.
