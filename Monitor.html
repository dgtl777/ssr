    There’s no better way to appreciate a game’s graphics than on a high-resolution monitor.
This 28-inch 4K monitor from BenQ was built specifically with gamers in mind. It has two HDMI ports and a DisplayPort, so you can hook up your gaming PC and game consoles to it at the same time.
The EL2870U supports HDR (high dynamic range), a video technology that makes colors look more lifelike, and AMD’s FreeSync, which reduces screen tearing and other visual glitches that can distract you while playing.
Most importantly, it has a 1ms (millisecond) response time, which reduces the amount of lag between what’s going on in the game, and what you’re doing. This level of precision isn’t necessary for everyday tasks, but makes a big difference when you’re playing games.
Finally, the EL2870U uses ambient light sensors to automatically adjust the monitor’s color temperature to make it easy to play games or use your computer at night.
