    The stereo system is made up of two hexagonal speakers tilted upward slightly, so sound is directed toward your face. The speakers have a 2.75-inch driver, and a bass port out the back that can help loud sounds — think explosions in a first person shooter or action game — sound big.
    The speakers can be connected to your computer with a cable, but they also support Bluetooth, so you can wirelessly stream music to them through a phone or tablet if you prefer. Volume controls are available on the right speaker for easy access if you need to make changes in the middle of your game.
    The feature that helps the G2000s stand above its competition is the programmable RGB light strip on the back of each speaker. You can cycle between 12 different colors by pressing a button on the right speaker; find the one that fits the game you’re playing, or other lights in your setup.
    Video games are a visual medium, but the G2000s will help you enjoy the soundtrack and ambient noises that make the world you’re playing in feel more alive.
